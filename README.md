- Bluesky API: Minimum 0.5 seconds between calls

### Memory Management
- Automatic memory monitoring during media processing
- Cleanup of downloaded media after processing
- Cache size limits to prevent memory leaks

## üìä Configuration Options

All configuration is done via environment variables. See `.env.example` for all available options.

### Key Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MAX_CONVERSATION_THREAD_DEPTH` | 50 | Max posts before bot stops replying |

| `MAX_THREAD_DEPTH_FOR_CONTEXT` | 25 | How much thread history to include |

## üöÄ Deployment

### Cloud Platforms

The bot is designed to work well on various cloud platforms:

- **Heroku**: Add environment variables in dashboard
- **Railway**: Connect GitHub repo and set environment variables  
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Use the included requirements.txt
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Deploy as container or serverless function

### Environment Setup for Production

1. Set `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` to reduce log verbosity
2. Consider using external services for persistence
3. Monitor memory usage and adjust limits as needed

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Developer Notifications
The bot automatically sends direct messages to @symm.social for:
- **Critical Errors**: Startup failures, API initialization problems
- **Connection Issues**: Persistent Jetstream connection problems  
- **Startup Notifications**: Successful bot initialization with status

Messages are sent via DM when possible, with fallback to public mentions if DMs fail.

### Logs
The bot provides comprehensive logging:
- `INFO`: General operation and successful actions
- `WARNING`: Non-critical issues and fallbacks
- `ERROR`: Failed operations and exceptions
- `DEBUG`: Detailed execution information

### Memory Monitoring
Built-in memory monitoring tracks usage during media processing and automatically cleans up resources.

## üõ† Customization

### Bot Personality
Edit the `BOT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` in `bot.py` to customize the bot's personality and behavior.

### Media Generation
- Images: Triggered by "IMAGE_PROMPT:" in responses
- Videos: Triggered by "VIDEO_PROMPT:" in responses
- Automatic alt-text generation for accessibility

### Thread Management
The bot automatically:
- Prevents duplicate replies
- Manages conversation depth
- Handles user-to-user vs bot conversations appropriately
